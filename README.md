# Weather-App
I Create This Weather App Using (HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT) From Scratch.

## Weather Page:
When user enter a Name of any place in the World and click the Button
We fetch for the weather condition in that place using weather api, 
and Display it for User. Otherwise If input value don't match anything 
an error message appears.

## Review Page : 
User can add Review and rating number, If they Pass the condition
the informations appears on a Board for 5 seconds with success message 
Otherwise we return an error message.

## User Form Validation :
1. Register Form validations using a good technique for showing errors or
success messages for input value validation. 

2. Login Form validation using fake users list (users from api users link)
To Compare you inputs with fake users information.
